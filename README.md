<p>This system allows users to find the best insurance cover that they're looking for depending on the type of cover they're looking for. The system has a list of insurance covers in the database that it can recommend to the user. The system has a set of questions prepared for the user upon selection of the type of insurance cover they're looking for e.g:</p>
<u>
<li>Motor Insurance</li>
<li>Health Insurance</li>
<li>Life Insurance</li>
</ul>
<h1>How it works</h1>
<p>The system uses a point system to find the best insurance cover for the user. Each insurance cover is assigned an average scorwe and each question of each insurance type is assigned a point based on the choice. So if a user selects choice "Yes" the system awards high points for that question and when the user selects choice "No" the system awards a low point for that same question.</p>
<p>Once the user has answered every question, all the points from all the choices are tallied and compared to the average scores of the individual insurance cover and the insurance cover whose average score is closest to the totaled score is then recommended to the user as the best insurance cover.</p>
